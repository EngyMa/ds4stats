	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
```

Read [this chapter](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/caret.html) on the __caret__ package. 

## Two digit example

Load the two digit example data

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data("mnist_27")
```

Build a prediction algorithm on the train set and test on the test set.

Hints: 

* Try out one of the models described [here](https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html).
* Learn to use the `train` function and the `tuneGrid` argument.

## Full MNIST example

Load the two digit example data

```{r}
mnist < read_mnist()
```

Build a prediction algorithm on the train set and test on the test set.
Hint: Learn to use the `trainControl` function so you can implement less computationally intensive cross validation options.
